A browser extension that brings a little nostalgic joy to your browsing experience
with retro 2D Pokemon sprites that follow your cursor around the web.

## About

PokéFollower started as a personal experiment to recapture that warm, playful feeling
of having a companion by your side while you work and browse. Whether you're tackling
a project, scrolling through social media, or just need a small friend to keep you
company, PokéFollower is here to make your screen time a bit more fun.

It was my girlfriend's idea, after I mentioned I wanted to build a plugin.

## macOS Desktop App

This fork adds a native macOS desktop mode: the same Pokémon follows your mouse
cursor across the whole desktop (over every app, not just web pages), using a
transparent click-through overlay. It reuses the extension's sprite engine and
settings popup as-is via a small Electron wrapper in `desktop/`.

### Run

```bash
npm install
npm run app
```

The app lives in the menu bar (Pokéball icon) — no Dock icon. From the tray menu
you can toggle the follower, open the Settings window (same UI as the extension
popup: pick a Pokémon, scale/distance/speed), or quit. Settings persist in
`~/Library/Application Support/pokefollower_cursor_web_plugin/settings.json`.

### Build a standalone .app

```bash
npm run dist   # outputs dist/mac*/PokeFollower.app (unsigned)
```

Notes:

- The overlay window is click-through and never steals focus; it hops between
  displays following your cursor.
- The sprite hides over full-screen apps only if macOS denies overlay windows
  there; normally `visibleOnFullScreen` keeps it visible.

## About Me

My name is **Ali**. I am trying to build more things, and this plugin was one of my
first accomplishments in learning how to do so.

## Your Feedback Matters

This extension is still evolving, and your input helps shape what comes next. Whether
you've found a bug, have a feature idea, or just want to share your experience, I'd
love to hear from you.

## What's Next

I'm working on adding more Pokemon generations, potentially new behaviors like attacks
or sitting, and emotes. If you have ideas or requests, let me know.

Thanks for being part of this journey. Happy browsing, and may your Pokemon companion
bring you good vibes.
